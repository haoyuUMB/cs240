## Problem

A string *C* of length *L* consisting of uppercase English characters is strictly increasing if, for every pair of
indices
*i* and *j* such that *1 ≤ i < j ≤ L* (1-based), the
character at position *i* is smaller than the character at position *j*.

For example, the strings ABC and ADF are strictly increasing, however the strings ACC and FDA are not.

Question: given a string S of length N, you have to find out, for every position 1≤i≤N, what is the length of the
longest strictly increasing substring that ends at position i.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line contains an integer N
, representing the length of the string.

The second line contains a string S
of length N
, consisting of uppercase English characters.

****

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y_1, y_2, ..., y_n
, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y_i
is the length of the longest strictly increasing substring that ends at position i.

### Hint:

The test set2 may run out of time limit if a straight out quadrantic algorithm is used. There
are two ways to save that.

1. Because the string only contains uppercase English letter, so the strictly increasing
   substring would never have a length bigger than 26. So for each position at most goes to
   left side 26 and does not have to start from index 0 always.
2. Starting from position 0, record the current longest strictly increasing length of
   substring. And of not strictly increasing, the current would be 1 and so on.

## Limits

Time limits: 60 seconds

1 ≤ T ≤ 100.

### Test Set 1

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

### Test Set 1

0 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.

## Sample

```c
Sample input:
2
4
ABBC
6
ABACDA

Sample output:
Case #1: 1 2 1 2
Case #2: 1 2 1 2 3 1

```

In Sample Case #1, the longest strictly increasing substring ending at position 1 is A. The longest strictly increasing
substrings ending at positions 2, 3 and 4 are AB, B and BC, respectively.

In Sample Case #2, the longest strictly increasing substrings for each position are A, AB, A, AC, ACD and A.
