# Requirements

1. Submit the two source files on to the Gradescope
2. Hard coding test cases get 0 points for all the rest of assignments

# Coding  (100 Points)

1. All test cases are given and there are no code templates
2. There are solution analysis in the end.
3. There are run time limits
4. Every test set runs 100 cases, avoid allocating
   and freeing memory frequently, since it may cause
   memory allocation issue, especially test set2. Try to use the same
   memory for each test case.
5. You should make sure your code runs on the
   largest case, since if that runs correctly,
   the other cases would be fine in terms of memory issue.
